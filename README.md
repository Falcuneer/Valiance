A RPG video game made with Java and JavaFx. Contracted a local artist to do pixel art. 

This assignment was a Final Project for my Intro to Computer Programming class at NMU freshman year. I had a vision for it and I knew that vision would take a long time to implement, so I started working on it as early as I could. I really enjoyed programming the basic functions, but also learning how to implement background music, sprites, and other functions of the game. Despite that, there were a lot of challenges, and mainting code this large was difficulty as well. Most of the time, one change illcited another change in a similar class. I had four main sprites for the characters, so if I changed one sprite class I had to change the rest. This caused me to tread on dangerous copy and paste waters, but I learned my lesson there. As you will see, I documented all the times I got stuck and the lessons I learned from visiting my professor. 

As for the art, a friend and I came up with the ideas for the sprites and she designed them using pixel art. After she finished them, it was a simple process to upload them to the game using JavaFX. 

My game is very rudimentary, I haven't touched it since freshman year, and by no means is it AAA worthy, but I enjoyed making it overall.
